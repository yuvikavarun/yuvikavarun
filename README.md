# 👋 Hey there, I’m Yuvika!

I'm a student currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Data Science and Applications from IIT Madras. I spend most of my time juggling between Python scripts, satellite images, filming content, and a million browser tabs.

## 🛰️ What I’m Working On

- Learning Remote Sensing Image analysis, and ML for geospatial data.
- Learning Research paper writing without losing my sanity
- Learning front-end development (one pixel at a time).
- Building a pixel-themed retro gaming page featuring Mario, Flappy Duck, and a bunch of other nostalgic chaos.
- Writing (at least trying) my own cheesy rom-com novel.
