# 👋 Hey there, I’m Yuvika!

🎓 I'm a student currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Data Science and Applications from IIT Madras. I spend most of my time juggling between Python scripts, satellite images, filming content, and a million browser tabs.

## 🛰️ What I’m Working On

- Learning Remote Sensing Image analysis, and ML for geospatial data.
- Learning Research paper writing without losing my sanity
- Learning front-end development (one pixel at a time).
- Building a pixel-themed retro gaming page featuring Mario, Flappy Duck, and a bunch of other nostalgic chaos.
- Writing (atleast trying) my own cheesy rom-com novel.
  
## 💡 My Recent Neurodivergent Hyperfixations:
- Physics, Astrophysics, and Mathematics
- Remote sensing (aka stalking the Earth from space)
- Defense & space tech 
- Data science & ML 📊
- Literature and Screenplay
- Research
  
## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages:**  
Python, HTML/CSS, SQL(kind of)

**Tools & Libraries:**  
VS Code, Git/GitHub, React, Tailwind

**Others:**  
 GIS | Google Earth Engine | SciPy | Canva (designs matter too!)
